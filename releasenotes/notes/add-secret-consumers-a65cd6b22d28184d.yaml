    The Barbican API has been extended to allow secrets to have one or
    more consumers.  This extension has been documented here:
    https://docs.openstack.org/barbican/latest/api/reference/secret_consumers.html

    This functionality has now been exposed in the barbican client.
    Users may add, remove or delete consumers by calling new methods on the
    SecretManager.  In addition, new CLI options have been provided to add, remove
    and list consumers.  See the documentation for details.
